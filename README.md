1. I would choose "Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed" because it automates the tests to see if it works or not, and it saves the time running it manually would do. Also it doesn't allow you to push it unless it passes which is a good safeguard to not push bad code.

2. Yes, I would use an E2E test to see if a function is returning the correct value.

3. The snapshot mode is less in depth compared to the navigation mode. Like fore example it gives a 2/4 for performance, while navigation gives it a 99/100.

4. For accessability you can make it to where the <html> tags have a [lang] attribute. For best practices you can change it to where it has a <meta name="viewport"> tag with width or initial-scale. Lastly for SEO make the document have meta descriptions.
